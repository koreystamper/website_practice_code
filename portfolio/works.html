					<h2>Software Development</h2>
					
					<p>Korey's love for games got him interested in the wonderful world of software development. Korey started learning Python by himself on freeCodeCamp. Then, he started learning about computer science concepts at GVSU using Java, C, and some C++. He is currently learning HTML/CSS and JavaScript for web site building. </p>
					
					<p>You can see some of his software development work at <a href="https://github.com/koreystamper" target="_blank">Korey's Github</a>.</p>

					<h2>Game Studies Research</h2>
					
					<p>In 2022, Korey researched Private Servers in online games. A private server is an online game server that is a divergent experiece of an already existing game. Korey noticed that as millions of players were leaving World of Warcraft (WoW) from 2011 to 2017, there were hundreds of thousands playing rogue servers, like Nostalria.</p>
					
					<p>In 2016, Blizzard Entertainment sent a cease and desist order to the developer of Nostalria. Over 800,000 accounts-- out of nowhere-- could no longer enjoy the classic WoW experience that Nostalria players did previously. Instead of working with the developer, Blizzard chose to shut him out.</p>
					
					<p>Cases like this allow researchers to draw parallels to other private server case studies in hopes of finding the reasons why folks love to play private servers. If you have data or information regarding a private server, reach out to me via my contact page.</p>
					
					<p>In 2023, Korey is developing a research project around the reward systems in MMORPGs.</p>

					<h2>Professional Writing</h2>
					
					<p>Korey's love for learning, empathy towards others, and ability to communicate enabled him to become a writing consultant for the Fred Meijer Center for Writing &amp; Michigan Authors in Summer of 2022. In one semester alone, he completed 71 appointments, with 100% positive feedback among all survey responders.</p>
					
					<p>Korey's professional work preferences are wide-open-- consulting others' writing, working in a publishing house, creating literature for tecnology and software-- he wants to try and do it all. As long as he is helping others by way of his writing and development skills, he'll be happy.</p>
